# Data Classification & Model Evaluation

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning algorithms to solve a classification problem. The project focuses on addressing **class imbalance** by using **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)** to ensure that the models perform fairly and accurately.

### Team Members:
- **Asep Jamaludin**
- **Syahril Arfian Almazril**
- **Ridho Anugrah Mulyadi**
- **Sayyid Faqih**

The project includes key steps such as **data preprocessing**, **model training**, **evaluation**, and handling class imbalance for improving model fairness.

## Key Features

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - **Cleaning**: Addressed missing values, outliers, and invalid data.
   - **Feature Engineering**: Created new features to improve model performance.
   - **Normalization & Scaling**: Applied **StandardScaler** to scale features to ensure models converge more efficiently.

### 2. **Machine Learning Models**
   We applied and evaluated multiple machine learning models:
   - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Effective for high-dimensional data.
   - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A distance-based classifier known for its simplicity and efficiency.
   - **Naive Bayes**: A probabilistic classifier based on Bayesâ€™ Theorem, ideal for high-dimensional data.

### 3. **Class Imbalance Handling**
   - **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)**: Used to generate synthetic data for the minority class to mitigate class imbalance, improving model performance.

### 4. **Model Evaluation**
   - **Evaluation Metrics**: Used **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, **F1-score**, and **confusion matrix** to evaluate model performance.
   - **Cross-validation**: Performed k-fold cross-validation to ensure the models generalize well and are not overfitted.
